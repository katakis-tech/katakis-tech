## 💡 A little about me:

I'm someone who likes to learn by breaking things (*gently*) and then putting them back together — better. Whether it’s scripting a guessing game in Python, setting up dual-boot systems, or wrangling routers, I like finding practical ways to make tech work smarter.

I’m especially into:
- Networking & Security concepts
- Real-world troubleshooting
- Scripting tiny tools to make life easier
- Finding the “why” behind the “what the heck?”
